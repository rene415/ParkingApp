# ParkingApp
This was my first attempt in using Java for android development. This was part of an internal hackathon at 42 Silicon Valley, and collaboration with ESD school. 

The main point of this app was to create an app that allows to find parking, instead of paying for public spaces we would get partnersips with the city and offer incentives to benifit local buisnesses.

We would not make money of the parking spots just the companies to advertise or give coupons

# Depart from parking spot:
The app would work as follows, once rider connects to their car,(bluetooth, aux) it will trigger notice to app saying that you are leaving.
There are many ways to detect this, easiest will be trough google.

# Driver Looking for parking:
Before driving a message will prompt how far you want to walk for parking and it will trigger a search from the destination you are going.
The app will start searching for parking in the area you chose once you are within the region you picked. it will then riderect you to that parking place.

# incentives:
You won't be able to give money to drivers we will give you coupons to use at different retails places. EI: you could get a free ticket to the botanical gardens, or a 10% disount on your next coffee run, etc.
